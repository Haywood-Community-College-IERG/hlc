# Step 2. HLC Application

::: {.callout-important}
About 30 days prior to submitting the application, the college should notify HLC of its intention to apply.
This allows HLC time to setup your college in their system prior to the actual application. 
The college will then be able to transfer the application fee funds[^s2_hlc_dues_and_fees] immediatly following the application.

You can use the [inquiry form](https://www.hlcommission.org/accreditation/begin-your-accreditation-journey/seeking-accreditation-inquiry-form/) {{< fa solid up-right-from-square title="A webpage link icon" >}} to start this conversation or submit a more formal letter of notifiction.
An example letter is provided below.
