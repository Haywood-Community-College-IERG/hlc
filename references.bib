  abstract = {This study had two purposes: to examine the expertise of doctoral students in their use of the scholarly literature and to investigate the use of citation analysis as a tool for collection development. Analysis of 1,842 coded citations gleaned from 30 education dissertations awarded in 2000 from 3 institutions in the United States revealed that journal articles, at 45\%, were cited most frequently, followed by monographs (33.9\%) and "other" (18.3\%), with magazines and Web sites contributing less than 2\% each of the total material types cited. The study examined 858 journal and magazine citations, which were found in 239 unique titles. A relatively small number of journals contained a high percentage of the references found in the dissertations analyzed. Based on a design by D. Kohl and L. Wilson (1986), dissertation citations were also scored for scholarliness, currency, and appropriateness of format, and scores on the three criteria were averaged to arrive at a quality rating. Results of interinstitutional comparisons revealed a significant amount of variation and were considered in conjunction with institutional characteristics and published criteria for quality bibliographies. The data suggest that the assumption of doctoral student expertise in their use of the scholarly literature may be overstated and should be examined in relation to their preparation for professional status. For purposes of developing a library's research collection, a core list of titles, generated on the basis of multiple, rather than single, institutional analysis is indicated.

However, little research in higher education has focused on the employment of data mining methods for predicting retention. Using three years of data for first time first year degree seeking students we compared results from logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, and ensemble models implemented using SAS Enterprise Miner. Based on validation misclassification rates and robustness, decision trees were chosen for the final model specification. Building models for three time periods (pre-enrollment or 1 day of term, 5 week of term, and end of term) the predictive accuracy of our decision trees improved with each shift in time. The score code generated from SAS Enterprise Miner will make it possible to create custom reports with color coded risk indicators within the SAS BI decision support system. This will enable administrators, advisors, professors and other higher education professionals within the institution to incorporate advanced analytics into retention efforts.},

A systematic review methodology was employed comprised of review protocol, requirements for study selection, and analysis of paper classification. The review aims to answer the following research questions: (1) what techniques are currently used to predict student retention rates, (2) which techniques have shown better performance under specific contexts?, (3) which factors influence the prediction of completion rates in higher education?, and (4) what are the challenges with predicting student retention? Increasing student retention in higher education is critical in order to increase graduation rates. Further, predicting student retention provides insight into opportunities for intentional student advising. The review provides a research perspective related to predicting student retention using machine learning through several key findings such as the identification of the factors utilized in past studies and methodologies used for prediction. These findings can be used to develop more comprehensive studies to further increase the prediction capability and; therefore, develop strategies to improve student retention.},

Improving student retention starts with a thorough  understanding of the reasons behind the attrition. In this study,  using student demographic and institutional data along with  several business intelligence (BI) techniques, we developed  prototype to predict likelihood of student persistence or dropout.  This study used classification models generated using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA). The model was built using the 10-fold cross validation, and holdout method (60\% of the data was used as training and the remaining as test and validation). Random sampling techniques were used in selecting the datasets. The attribute selection analysis of the models revealed that the student age on entry, parent occupation, health of student and financial variables are among the most important predictors of the phenomenon. Results of the classifiers were compared using accuracy level, confusion matrices and speed of model building benchmarks. The study shows that identifying the relevant student background factors can be incorporated to design a prototype that can serve as valuable tool in predicting student withdrawal or persistence as well as recommend the necessary intervention strategies to adopt, leading to better education efficiency.}

  abstract = {Background: Knowledge of concepts and procedures seems to develop in an iterative fashion, with increases in one type of knowledge leading to increases in the other type of knowledge. This suggests that iterating between lessons on concepts and procedures may improve learning. Aims: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the instructional benefits of an iterative lesson sequence compared to a concepts-before-procedures sequence for students learning decimal place-value concepts and arithmetic procedures. Samples: In two classroom experiments, sixth-grade students from two schools participated (N=77 and 26). Method: Students completed six decimal lessons on an intelligent-tutoring systems. In the iterative condition, lessons cycled between concept and procedure lessons. In the concepts-first condition, all concept lessons were presented before introducing the procedure lessons. Results: In both experiments, students in the iterative condition gained more knowledge of arithmetic procedures, including ability to transfer the procedures to problems with novel features. Knowledge of concepts was fairly comparable across conditions. Finally, pre-test knowledge of one type predicted gains in knowledge of the other type across experiments. Conclusions: An iterative sequencing of lessons seems to facilitate learning and transfer, particularly of mathematical procedures. The findings support an iterative perspective for the development of knowledge of concepts and procedures.},

  abstract = {What does informal formative assessment look like in the context of scientific inquiry teaching? Is it possible to identify different levels of informal assessment practices? Can different levels of informal assessment practices be related to levels of student learning? This study addresses these issues by exploring how 4 middle school science teachers used questions as a method of informal formative assessment, and compares those practices to measures of student learning. The approach to exploring each teacher's questioning practices is based on viewing whole-class discussions as assessment conversations in which the teacher has the opportunity to draw out and act on students' evolving understanding. Assessment conversations are described as consisting of four-step cycles, where the teacher elicits a question, the student responds, the teacher recognizes the student's response, and then uses the information collected to student learning. Our results indicate that the teachers whose enactment of informal formative assessment was more consistent with this model had students with higher performance on embedded assessments. This trend was also reflected in the posttest scores. In addition, we found that teachers focused more on epistemic, rather than conceptual, features of scientific inquiry in their discussions. The study underlines the importance of informal formative assessment during scientific inquiry discussions for teacher training and professional development as a way to increase student learning.},

Formative assessment visualizes that in each stage of the teaching-learning process there is a scope to provide feedbacks and correctives. There is a differentiation in long-cycle, short-cycle, and medium-cycle formative assessments. On the other hand, the summative assessment, like grading, is useful to describe where the student stands, rather than focus on the progress made. The judging and classifying of students is the traditional role. It is observed that often summative assessment is pressed into service for a formative purpose. The curriculum pressure dissuades the teacher to adopt formative approach.},
